## Hi there 👋

# 💼 Abdul Rahman Samy

**Infrastructure Architect | Cloud Automation Strategist | Compliance & Resilience Advocate**

## 🔧 About Me

I’m a meticulous and resourceful cloud infrastructure professional specializing in scalable, secure, and auditable systems using Google Cloud Platform and Terraform. With a keen eye for clarity and precision, I design impactful solutions that enable resilient architectures and organizational excellence.

Whether I'm architecting PostgreSQL high availability setups, implementing IAM strategies with Terraform, or aligning technical messaging for stakeholders—I'm driven by a commitment to quality and continuous refinement.

## 🧠 Core Competencies

- **Terraform Automation**  
  Modular designs, parameterized workflows, service account impersonation, IAP-based SSH access.

- **PostgreSQL High Availability**  
  WAL archiving, repmgr failover monitoring, physical and logical backups.

- **GCP Load Balancing**  
  HTTP(S) and internal TCP integrations with PgBouncer for connection scalability.

- **Google Workspace Integration**  
  OAuth 2 Client ID setup, domain-wide delegation, and group provisioning.

- **Audit & Compliance**  
  IAM visibility and logging, audit trails, offsite backup via rsync.

- **Advanced Git Workflows**  
  Subtree and sparse-checkout methods, symbolic vs hard links handling.

- **Strategic Communication**  
  Professional messaging that aligns technical execution with business goals.

## 🚀 Philosophy & Approach

I see infrastructure not just as a technical foundation but a strategic enabler. Every configuration should reflect resilience, clarity, and adaptability. Governance and branding aren’t extras—they’re fundamentals to scalable systems.

## 🌍 Values

- **Precision**: Execution with attention to detail.
- **Security**: Smart automation and auditable controls.
